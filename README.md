In the WeatherPy I calculated and mapped cloudiness, humidity, and temperatures below and above the equator. I used Linear Regression to determine if latitude was a reasonable indicator of temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness.

Findings:

Tempature: Tempature was affected by Latitude. The further away you go from the equator the colder the temperatures get. The further you move away from it the warmer your temperature. Thus, our findings prove that we can use latitude as a way to determine how warm or cold a place might be. 

Cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed:

Latitude alone would not be able to be used to determine how humid, cloudy, or windy a place would be. 

In conclusion, Latitude alone will not be able to be used to determine 3 of the 4 parameters. That being said, latitude can tell us if the climate of a location would be warmer or hotter depending on its distance from the equator. 

In VacationPy



I set parameters based on the ideal temperature and humidity I would enjoy on a vacation. Using those parameters I created a map showing the most ideal locations within that. If you were to plug in different min, max, and humidity the map would display different locations and hotel names. Also, it will show darker or lighter dots depending on how humid a location is. However, you could easily change that by switching out c='humidity' for a different parameter.
